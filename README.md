# hello-world
First attempt at learning github!!! Here we go!!!

Hey, my name is Kamande. I mostly code in C++ and a bit of python.
I am currently learning more about data structures and algorithms and I'm having a blast doing it. I love coding and learning how to improve human life through coding. I'm also currently studying to become a biomedical engineer in Kenya.
Anyway that's me. Have a nice day!
